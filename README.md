# React Native FlatList renders empty list after successful API call

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after a successful API call.  The issue is caused by improper error handling and/or asynchronous operations.

## Bug Description

A React Native application fetches data from an API.  The API call is successful, but the FlatList component remains empty.  There are no error messages in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking the response status from the API call and correctly handling potential errors.  Also, ensuring that the data is correctly formatted for the FlatList to render it effectively is crucial.  The solution includes robust error handling and logging to assist in debugging.
